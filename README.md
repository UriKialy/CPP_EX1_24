Absolutely, here is the README file for your project, including a minor grammatical error:

**Algorithms.hpp**

This header file defines the `Algorithms` class which provides various graph algorithms implemented in C++.

**Includes**

* `<vector>`: Provides functionalities for dynamic arrays.
* `<iostream>`: Provides functionalities for input and output streams.
* `<bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes commonly used functionalities from the C++ Standard Library.
* `Graph.hpp`: Includes the definition of the `Graph` class.
* `<string>`: Provides string manipulation functionalities.

**Namespace**

* `ariel`: Encapsulates the functionalities within the `ariel` namespace.

**Class: Algorithms**

This class provides various graph algorithms:

* `isConnected(Graph g)`: Checks if a graph is connected and returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.
* `shortestPath(Graph &g, int start, int end)`: Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a graph and returns it as a string. If there is no path, it returns an empty string.
* `isContainsCycle(Graph g)`: Checks if a graph contains a cycle and returns true if it does, false otherwise.
* `isBipartite(Graph g)`: Checks if a graph is bipartite and returns a string indicating the bipartition or an empty string if the graph is not bipartite.
* `negativeCycle(Graph g)`: Finds a negative cycle in a graph and returns it as a string. If there is no negative cycle, it returns "no negative cycle".
* `getNeighbors(Graph graph, unsigned long vertex)`: Gets the list of neighbors for a given vertex in the graph and returns it as a vector.

**Compiling and Running**

The project uses a Makefile to compile and run the code. You can compile the code using the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable named `demo`. You can then run the program using the following command:

```bash
./demo
```
